# Issues: agent-team-ux

## [2026-01-28T23:16:32] Pre-existing Issues Noted
- LSP errors in agent-ui/src/components/ApiMonitoring.tsx (unrelated to this plan)

## [2026-01-28T23:17] Wave 1 Delegation Failed
- Task 1 (Demo Script): Agent failed with JSON parse error
- Task 2 (Storage Schema): Agent failed with JSON parse error
- Neither deliverable was created (.sisyphus/demos/ and .sisyphus/designs/ don't exist)
- Agents made unrelated changes to agent-ui and src files instead
- Root cause: Likely prompt complexity or delegation system issue
- Action: Retry with simpler, more direct prompts
