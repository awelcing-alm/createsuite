SCENE 3: Wow Moment (Auto-planning)

Test: Can the system create plans and route tasks appropriately?

Expected Behavior (from demo script):
- User creates task: "Add dark mode toggle to settings page"
- System analyzes complexity
- Recommends workflow: Plan → Execute
- Prometheus generates plan
- Shows 4-step plan with specific steps

Actual Status: COMPONENTS EXIST BUT NOT INTEGRATED
✅ SmartRouter is fully functional
  - Analyzes complexity: trivial/simple/complex/team
  - Returns confidence scores and reasoning
  - All test cases passed
  
✅ PlanManager is fully functional
  - Creates plans in .createsuite/plans/
  - Loads plans from markdown
  - Converts plans to CreateSuite tasks
  - All test cases passed
  
⚠️  INTEGRATION MISSING:
  - CLI task create command does NOT use SmartRouter
  - No automatic Prometheus integration
  - No workflow recommendation display
  - Plans not auto-generated on task creation

GAP ANALYSIS:
✅ Core logic components (SmartRouter, PlanManager) work correctly
❌ Integration between components is missing
❌ Task creation doesn't trigger complexity analysis
❌ No automatic workflow recommendations shown
❌ Prometheus integration exists but not connected to task flow

VERDICT: CORE LOGIC WORKS, INTEGRATION MISSING
The building blocks exist but aren't wired together
