SCENE 4: Desktop UI and First Task

Test: Can user launch Desktop app and see agent work?

Expected Behavior (from demo script):
- User runs `cs ui`
- Electron window opens with Windows 95 aesthetic
- Shows Sisyphus agent working on task
- Real-time terminal output visible
- Click "Agent Village" to see visualization

Actual Status: BLOCKER - CANNOT LAUNCH
❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: `npm run electron:dev` script does NOT exist
   - entrypoint.ts expects to run this script
   - agent-ui/package.json only has: dev, build, lint, preview
   - electron:dev is documented in ELECTRON.md but not in package.json
   
✅ Command exists: `cs ui --help` shows --demo flag
✅ Electron files exist: agent-ui/electron/main.js, preload.js
✅ Documentation exists: ELECTRON.md explains electron:dev workflow

GAP ANALYSIS:
❌ BLOCKER: Missing npm script prevents Desktop launch
❌ Cannot test Desktop app functionality
❌ Cannot capture screenshots of UI
❌ Cannot verify agent visualization

ROOT CAUSE:
The Task 5 deliverable was to "Fix Desktop App Single-Process Launch"
- Added `--demo` flag to CLI ✅
- Modified cli.ts ui command ✅
- BUT did not verify agent-ui/package.json has electron:dev script ❌

VERDICT: BLOCKER
Desktop app cannot be launched due to missing npm script
All other CLI functionality is working
