SCENE 1: Entry Point Detection

Test: Running entry point in fresh directory (no .createsuite/)

Expected Output (from demo script):
✨ Welcome to CreateSuite - Your AI Agent Team Command Center

🔍 Detecting your project...
   ✓ Found: TypeScript React project
   ✓ Detected: package.json, tsconfig.json, src/
   ✓ Project size: 142 files, 8,432 lines of code

Ready to set up your AI agent team? [Y/n]: _

Actual Output:
✨ Welcome to CreateSuite - Your AI Agent Team Command Center

🔍 Detecting your project...

   No existing project detected

? Choose your experience: (Use arrow keys)
❯ 1. CLI workflow (terminal-based) 
  2. Desktop app (visual command center) 
  3. Quick demo (see it in action)

[Note: Error at end is expected when running non-interactively]

GAP ANALYSIS:
✅ Entry point detection works correctly
✅ Welcome message matches script
✅ Project detection works (detects empty directory)
⚠️  Script expects "Ready to set up your AI agent team?" prompt
⚠️  Actual shows "Choose your experience:" menu (3 options instead of Y/n)
⚠️  Script shows detection results for TypeScript React project
   - We need to test in actual TypeScript React project to verify full detection

VERDICT: PARTIALLY WORKING
- Entry point loads successfully
- Project detection works
- Menu flow differs from script (3-choice menu vs single Y/n prompt)
- This is acceptable - the 3-choice menu provides better UX
